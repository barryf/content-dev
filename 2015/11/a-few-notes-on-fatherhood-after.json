      "A few notes on fatherhood after my first week:\r\n\r\n- Even though I was warned I still took sleep for granted.\r\n- Changing a dirty nappy really is no big deal. But he soils them almost as quickly as I change them.\r\n- It's impossible to have too many vests or baby-gros.\r\n- Ditto nappies and water wipes. The magic [nappy bin](http://www.tommeetippee.co.uk/product/nappy-disposal-system/) is my friend.\r\n- Muslins, cloths or wipes must be within reach at all times or else.\r\n- For now he really does just want to feed, nap and poo all day long.\r\n- My wife does the feeding so I do the housework. And quite right too.\r\n- Leaving the house to drive to the supermarket was momentous.\r\n- He may have irrevocably changed our lives and we may never sleep uninterrupted again but he's worth it.\r\n"
