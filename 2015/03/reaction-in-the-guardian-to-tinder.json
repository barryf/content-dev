      "[Reaction in the Guardian to Tinder's new Plus tier:](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/04/tinder-limit-users-over-30-limit-creeps)\r\n\r\n> I probably wouldn’t pay $19.99 a month (the senior anti-discount for Tinder Plus) just for the privilege of getting take-backs on my mistaken swipes. But I’d pay extra to be an over-30 on Tinder if it meant I had an option where under-30s couldn’t interact with me.\r\n\r\nThere's still plenty of room in the dating market beyond Tinder and free sites for those wiling to pay for a better experience on a specialised site. Choosing a site dedicated to a specific age range will filter out the \"creeps\" you don't want to hear from.\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: [day job](http://whitelabeldating.com))."
