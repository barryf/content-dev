But I’d pay extra to be an over-30 on Tinder if it meant I had an option where under-30s couldn’t interact with me.\r\n\r\nThere's still plenty of room in the dating market beyond Tinder and free sites for those wiling to pay for a better experience on a specialised site. Choosing a site dedicated to a specific age range will filter out the \"creeps\" you don't want to hear from.\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: [day job](http://whitelabeldating.com))."],"published":["2015-03-04T14:22:37Z"],"entry-type":["note"],"category":["dating","tinder"],"slug":["reaction-in-the-guardian-to-tinder"]}}
