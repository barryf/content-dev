      "In September 2006 I posted one of the first ever tweets about [Arsenal Football Club](http://arsenal.com), lamenting my team's fondness for [always trying to walk it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWJIQm9qH-w) after watching a [frustrating draw with Middlesborough](http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-we-put-ourselves-in-trouble-) at The Emirates.\r\n\r\nhttps://barryf.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/perfect-goal.png\r\n\r\nEvery now and again someone rediscovers it and I get a barrage of retweets and replies, some polite, others from goading fans of other teams seeing the activity and incorrectly assuming I'm talking about the current team. \n\nSo reluctantly I've deleted the tweet and my phone is silent once more.\r\n"
