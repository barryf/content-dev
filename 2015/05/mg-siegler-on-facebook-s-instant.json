Your content better load fast or youâ€™re screwed.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm not overly keen on the prospect of content moving within Facebook's walled garden, if it means existing news sites have to up their game and improve their dog-slow, bloated, marketing-led, advert-riddled mobile web experiences then we all benefit.
