      "\"The Waterloo Bridge Handicap\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xqMMRvQnzsY?t=10m30s (race commentary from 10m30s)\n\r\nLove this clip of Leonard Rossiter 'racing' other commuters which was played on the screen at [last night's Belle and Sebastian gig](/2015/05/superb-belle-and-sebastian-gig-tonight). The race follows the same route I take when working in our London office. I also always end up pretend-racing others walking across the bridge up to the Strand. I wonder if they're also in on it?\r\n\r\n"
