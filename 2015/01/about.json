I live in a village in Surrey with my wife, Laura.\n\nSince [January 2008](http://www.whitelabeldating.com/press/whitelabeldating-com-appoints-technical-director/) I've been [CTO](http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryfrost 'Chief Technical Officer') of [Venntro](http://venntro.com/), a British online dating company that creates the software and runs the back-end for over 45M members on 25,000 worldwide dating sites through our [White Label Dating](http://www.whitelabeldating.com/) product. I head up our 45-strong [development team](http://dev.venntro.com/).\n\nPreviously I've worked in web agencies, corporates and startups, big and small, in and around London and New Zealand. You can read more about my professional background on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryfrost). \n\n*Any views or content posted here does not necessarily represent the views of my company.*\n\n## Hacking\n\nMy day job is increasingly spent in Google Apps and meetings. Not so long ago I was a full-time developer and although I love my current job, I miss learning and creating new things. This site (and other personal projects) is my way of trying to practise and keep my development skills up-to-date.\n\nSince stumbling across the [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) movement a few years ago I've been tinkering with my own platform to participate. This is my attempt to *[selfdogfood](http://indiewebcamp.com/selfdogfood)* by using the tool I'm building as my own personal site.\n\nRead about how this is built and the ideas behind it in the [colophon](/colophon).\n\n## Interests\n\nI try to be an early adopter (my Twitter account [@barryf](http://twitter.com/barryf) is the 4,677th) and I enjoy trying new services and technologies to help improve my team’s effectiveness and happiness. I’ve been a Mac user since the early 2000s and have owned more iOS devices than I want to think about. \n\nAway from technology, I’m a football fan, I enjoy rugby and cricket, [indie/rock music](http://last.fm/user/barryf), I like to keep up with politics and I try (unsuccessfully) to avoid showbiz news.\n\n## Interviews\n\n- [Interview on HackerJobs, February 2013](http://hackerjobs.co.uk/blog/2013/2/27/hacker-jobs-meets-barry-frost-cto-of-globaldev)\n- [Video interview on Online Personals Watch, August 2012](http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2012/08/interview-with-barry-frost-cto-of-whitelabeldating.html)\n- [Interview with Edge, August 2012](http://globalpersonals.co.uk/blog/edge-interviews-barry-frost/)\n- [Case study with Rackspace UK (PDF)](http://stories.rackspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CRP-Global-Personals-UK-Case-Study-Final.pdf)\n\n## Contact\n\n[Email, iMessage, Tweet or Skype me](/contact)."],"published":["2015-01-04T15:47:00Z"],"entry-type":["article"],"name":["About"],"slug":["about"]}}
