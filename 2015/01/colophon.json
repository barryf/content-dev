      "This site is powered by my own IndieWeb-compliant publishing tool. It's my home for all my notes, articles, bookmarks, photos and more, hosted on my personal domain rather than in someone's silo. I can choose how it looks and works while having fun building it for myself.\n\nI've been following the [principles](http://indiewebcamp.com/principles) and [recommendations](http://indiewebcamp.com/IndieMark) of the amazing [IndieWebCamp](http://indiewebcamp.com/) community who have discussed, documented and *selfdogfooded* the approaches I'm experimenting with here.\n\n## Features\n\n- Self-hosting using my personal, primary domain\n- Posting of all my notes, articles, bookmarks, photos, replies, reposts and likes directly on my site\n- [POSSE](http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE \"Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere\") syndication of my content to silos (e.g. Twitter) via [Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy)\n- Microformats 2 markup, including [h-entry](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) and [h-card](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card)\n- Send and receive replies, reposts, likes and mentions using [Webmention](http://webmention.org) with [backfeeding](http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed) from silos\n- [Reply/repost/like contexts](http://indiewebcamp.com/reply-context) fetched and displayed above posts\n- Authentication via [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com/) and `rel=\"me\"` links\n- [Micropub](http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub) posting as the primary method of creation for all post types\n- [Webaction](https://indiewebcamp.com/webactions) buttons to allow actions on Twitter directly from a post\n- Storage using text files in Markdown and YAML front-matter metadata\n\n## Micropub\n\nRather than build an admin system for creating posts, I've attempted to do without. Instead I've exposed an API endpoint that's compliant with the (emerging) [Micropub](http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub) specification for posting using an authenticated third party app.\n\nUsing a tool like [Quill](https://quill.p3k.io) I can authenticate with [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com/) and then post notes, bookmarks and likes to my site. A successful post is stored on my server which then fires off any webmentions, syndications to Twitter/Facebook/Pinboard and fetches reply/repost/like contexts for display if appropriate.\n\nAlternatively I can write (or edit) a post as a file and simply `scp` or `rsync` it to my server.\n\n## Webmentions\n\nInstead of a comments form, my site supports replies, reposts, likes or mentions via [Webmention](http://webmention.org) from another IndieWeb site. If someone wants to respond to a post they can write their note on their own site using Microformats 2 `h-entry` markup and send a webmention ping to my endpoint.\n\nTheir `h-entry` will then be parsed, stored and added underneath my post with an icon indicating its type. Additional posts from the same permalink will update it.\n\nAnd using the magic of [Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy), responses to my tweets, Facebook posts and Instagram photos that have been syndicated from my site are pulled back in as webmentions.\n\n## Storage\n\nAll posts, webmentions and reply contexts are saved to disk as the primary method of storage. Files are then scanned, indexed and cached using [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org). These posts can be flushed and completely rebuilt from the raw files if needed.\n\nWhy the dual approach? I wanted the flexibility to `rsync` files to/from my server without worrying about database dumps and restores, but wanted the speed of a database to query and sort the data to serve as HTML. Also, with all content in flat text files, I'm confident that I could easily migrate to another platform.\n\nContent is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format with [YAML front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) metadata similar to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). For example:\n\n    –––\n    published: \"2015-01-03 23:29:11 UTC\"\n    permalink: \"/2015/01/this-is-an-example\"\n    post_type: note\n    tags:\n    - example\n    - personal\n    –––\n    This is an example post. **This is in bold**\n    \n    Another paragraph\n\nAs well as previous articles, I've imported tweets and bookmarks that I've been posting since 2004. I now have all my own content stored on my own site.\n\n## Also\n\n- All pages and assets are served via SSL (https)\n- RSS feeds of new [posts](/index.xml) and [webmentions](/webmentions.xml)\n- Auto-embedding of images and YouTube videos linked in posts\n- View posts by tags, e.g. [indieweb](/tag/indieweb)\n- Monthly archive index pages\n- Navigate index pages using pagination\n\n## Using\n\n- Ruby 2.2\n- [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), [Webmention](https://github.com/indieweb/mention-client-ruby) and [Microformats2](https://github.com/G5/microformats2) gems\n- [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org) on [nginx](http://nginx.org)\n- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org)\n- Ubuntu VPS on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)\n\n\n"
