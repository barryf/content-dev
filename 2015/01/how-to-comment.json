Here's how it's done.\n\n## Short version\n\n1. Publish a post on your own site with [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) markup. Use [h-entry](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) for the content and [h-card](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) for your profile.\n1. Link back to my post with `rel=\"in-reply-to\"`.\n1. Send a [Webmention](http://webmention.org) from your post to mine.\n1. I'll then parse your comment and display it below my post.\n\n## Longer version\n\n### Write \n\nPublish a post on your own site with [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) markup. You don't need any special software, just a tool that allows you to enter raw HTML.\n\n    <div class=\"h-entry\">\n      <div class=\"e-content\">I agree with you, Barry.</div>\n      <div class=\"p-author h-card\">John Smith</div>\n    </div>\n\n### Link back\n\nLink back to my post with `rel=\"in-reply-to\"`. This doesn't need to be part of the above h-entry, but should be placed somewhere on your post's permalink page.\n\n    <a href=\"https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/a-post\" rel=\"in-reply-to\">\n      Barry Frost's post about something important\n    </a>\n\nInstead of a comment you can alternatively indicate that you have **liked** or **reposted** my post by adding a `u-like-of` or `u-repost-of` to your link:\n\n    <a href=\"https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/a-post\" class=\"u-like-of\">\n      I liked this\n    </a>\n    <a href=\"https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/a-post\" class=\"u-repost-of\">\n      I reposted this\n    </a>\n    \n### Webmention \n\nFinally, send a Webmention from your post to mine to let me know you have a comment for me to retrieve.\n\nMy Webmention endpoint is: https://barryfrost.com/webmention. Send an HTTP POST to this URL with the following form variables (using your own URLs of course):\n\n- `source=YOUR_POST_PERMALINK`\n- `target=MY_POST_PERMALINK`\n\nYou can use one of [several clients](https://github.com/indieweb) to send your Webmention, but the simplest way to do this is via [curl](http://curl.haxx.se):\n\n    $ curl -i -d \"source=YOUR_POST_PERMALINK&target=MY_POST_PERMLINK\" \\\n    https://barryfrost.com/webmention\n\nIf your Webmention to me fails for any reason [let me know](/contact) and I'll be more than happy to help you debug.\n\n### Display\n\nIf successful, my server will parse your post, fetch your comment and add it below my original post.\n"],"published":["2015-01-17T11:36:00Z"],"entry-type":["article"],"name":["How to comment"],"slug":["how-to-comment"]}}
