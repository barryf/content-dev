      "I've been forcing myself to like/repost tweets and Instagram photos exclusively through POSSE since 1st Jan. Although I get a self-righteous feeling of \"correctness\" it does take a few extra steps of copy-and-pasting URLs and I probably act on fewer things as a result.\n\nUsing PESOS for likes (and optionally reposts?) seems like an acceptable trade-off (I would still POSSE my replies). I already have a Micropub endpoint so in theory it should Just Work on my site, although I appreciate your audience is smaller for this. I'd certainly be happy to help test it."
