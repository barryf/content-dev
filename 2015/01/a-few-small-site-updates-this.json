      "A few small site updates this evening. I've updated my Micropub syndication handling to work with PHP-style arrays as per [Aaron](http://aaronparecki.com)'s [new approach](https://github.com/aaronpk/Quill/commit/1c4bf54da4ca2419598a8cb541b3cb3737452aab).\n\nSecondly, after a few garbled webmentions, I've switched away from the [Ruby Microformats 2 parser](https://github.com/G5/microformats2) to use the [PHP library](https://github.com/indieweb/php-mf2/) which seems to be more complete, especially for nested attributes."
