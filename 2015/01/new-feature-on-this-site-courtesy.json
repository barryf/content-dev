      "New feature on this site courtesy of [Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy): I can now \"like\" photos on Instagram. Using [Quill](http://quill.p3k.io) I first post a like to an Instagram photo's permalink. This is then sent to my site's endpoint which creates the page and sends a webmention for Bridgy to notify Instagram. Meanwhile my site grabs the image thumbnail and title to display on my site. \n\nFor example: here's a like from this morning: https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/11-084931\n\nAll very easy. I just glue together the loosely coupled pieces."
