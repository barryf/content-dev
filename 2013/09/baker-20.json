      "One of my favourite Gmail productivity hacks is to hide the inbox label with CSS. Instead of being tempted to find out what's behind the **(1)** indicator I can safely search and process through my starred items oblivious to any incoming emails.  \r\n\r\nWhen I'm ready to return to the inbox I can simply press `g` then `i`.\r\n\r\n    .LrBjie .TK .aim:nth-child(1) { display: none; }\r\n\r\nI use [Mailplane](http://mailplaneapp.com/) to manage my Gmail accounts which helpfully supports custom CSS, although you can also use browser extensions like [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/) to apply userstyles.\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: This will most probably break when/if Gmail updates its design.*"
