      "I think I'll need to hide replies on my homepage posts list. It can get a bit noisy when I'm in a conversation on Twitter and my own public content slips down the page. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I should move replies to a dedicated [replies page](http://aaronparecki.com/replies) like [Aaron Parecki](http://aaronparecki.com) has?\r\n\r\nThe mixed public/replies approach is actually something I dislike when visiting profiles on Twitter: I want to see what people are sharing, not (only) their replies to others.\r\n\r\n**Update, 9pm**: [Done](/replies)."
