      "[Mike Elgan on the future of FaceTime, including how FaceTime Audio should override voice calls like iMessage does for SMS](http://www.cultofmac.com/247673/why-its-time-for-apple-to-open-facetime/) \r\n\r\n> From the user’s perspective, FaceTime should work like iMessage. If Apple did it right, you’d be able to simply use it to make all your calls — video and audio. If the person you’re calling has FaceTime, great! If they don’t, that should be when the phone fails over to either the regular carrier’s phone system or another VoIP alternative. Or, it would connect to the other user’s FaceTime-compatible app.\r\n\r\n(via [Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2013/10/why-its-time-for-apple-to-open-facetime/))\r\n\r\n[I thought the same last year](https://twitter.com/barryf/statuses/175168677170266112) while at the [Mobile World Congress](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com). We should focus on making experiences seamless so users don't need to think about the underlying technology, just the action they're trying to do."
