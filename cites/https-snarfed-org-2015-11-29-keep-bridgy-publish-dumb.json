      "Bridgy has three parts:\nlisten, publish,\nand blogs. One of them is not like the others. \n\n Listening for responses to your silo posts and\nbackfeeding them to your web site was the\nfirst service Bridgy provided, and it’s still the most popular. It runs entirely\nin the background. No UI needed. \n\n Blog webmentions run entirely in the background too. Bridgy sends webmentions\nfor you when you write a post, and it receives webmentions and adds them to your\nposts behind the scenes. Again, no UI needed. \n\n Publish, however, is a different beast. It has a user interface, which is where\nmost people start. Even after that, when they\nautomate it via webmention, they often still\nwant an interface of some sort or another to customize their silo posts, and\nthat’s where the trouble starts. \n\n POSSEing is simple sometimes, complicated\nother times. You craft tweet text, convert formatting, and translate mentions\nand tags (or not). These are not one-way operations. Characters need to be\ncounted, formatting iterated, mentions auto-filled. You’ll want to preview your\npost. You need multiple round trips against the original post using a rich,\ninteractive UI. Honestly, you need all that inside your CMS. \n\n Like the rest of Bridgy, Publish is a service. It has just two operations,\npublish and preview, which doesn’t exactly lend it to richness or interactivity.\nWe could force the issue and make plugins for the bigger CMSes – Known,\nWordPress, etc. – but I think that’s a losing battle. I wouldn’t build them\nmyself, and I’d look hard at any new features they needed. \n\n I love that Bridgy Publish lets people POSSE their posts without implementing\nsilo APIs themselves. That’s why I built it! And I’m flattered that they\nlike\nit\nenough\nto\nask\nfor\nmore\nand\nmore\nuser-facing\nfeatures. It’s just not the\nright place for them.\nFortunately, it’s not the only game in town.. \n\n The one concession I’m considering is\nletting users specify the exact text\nto publish in their silo post. This would let advanced users craft custom posts\nfor each silo in their CMS, and still reuse Bridgy’s POSSE API code. That’s it\nthough. \n\n Bridgy can and should be a best of breed backfeed service. Bridgy Publish, on\nthe other hand, cannot be a best of breed POSSE service. My strongest\ninclination at this point is to keep it dumb, define precisely how it translates\nyour original posts to silo posts, and avoid trying to offer UX where none can\nsurvive. It’s a mug’s game. \n\n Also on IndieNews."
