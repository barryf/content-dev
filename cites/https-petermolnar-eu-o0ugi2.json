I’d only try London if Cambridge fails as an option.  \n The main reason for Cambridge &amp; the University is that I’d like to get some of the students involved; they could then localize the idea and spread it in their native language, which, I believe, is a barrier for the indieweb at the moment. \n But if you want to do one in London, I’d be happy to co-organize that :)"],"in-reply-to":["https://barryfrost.com/2016/01/hi-peter-i-d-be-happy"],"author":["https://petermolnar.eu/"]}}
