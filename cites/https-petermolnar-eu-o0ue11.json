      "Hi; you get this mention because you said you’re around London on the indieweb/irc-people page. I’ve recently started looking into organizing an IndieWebCamp in Cambridge (the UK one, the US one is doing it already), but the first point of Planning says: \"Find at least one committed co-organizer\".
