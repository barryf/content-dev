{"type":["h-entry"],"properties":{"content":["Only a week to go! On Friday 20th at 11:15am Sue and I will leave England for at least a year to travel, live, work and drink beer all around the world. Our first stop is Bangkok for a night's stop-over and then we'll leave the ladyboys behind for the 48 million sheep of New Zealand.  We plan for the Land of the Long White Cloud to be our home for about nine months. Then it's Australia, Fiji, Honolulu, Los Angeles and then back to London.\n\nWe're going with the nice people from BUNAC who sorted out our visas and everything. We're also going with forty other travelly types who could be axe murdererers but will most probably be a good laugh.  Anyway, this should be the start of many (far more interesting) entries so come back soon!"],"published":["2000-10-14T00:00:00Z"],"slug":["only-week-to-go-on-friday-20th-at"],"entry-type":["note"],"category":["travelblog"]}}
