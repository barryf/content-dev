      "It's D-day today. Sue and I have both got interviews with job agencies and we also find out whether we've \"won\" our dream house. I'm actually far more nervous about the latter seeing us the other group of BUNACers who'd be waiting have been gasumped - the estate agents informed them that someone else had moved in! Which is nice. \n\nI'm off to Enterprise in an hour who will hopefully set me up with some IT work and Sue's going to Select. Fingers crossed."
