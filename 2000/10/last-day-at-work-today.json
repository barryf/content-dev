      "Last day at work today.  Seems weird because I've spent nine years working here on and off and have seen so many people leave and now it's my turn.  We're off to the Griffin in Danbury after work and we'll doubtless have a few beers to celebrate finally getting rid of me.  So, cheers to everyone at RDIU and keep in touch!"
