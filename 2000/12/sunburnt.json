      "Sunburnt. Not hugely, because I did put sun cream on, but enough to get the nickname \"beetroot\" at work. The ozone layer's so thin here that even when it's cloudy you can get burnt - must remember to \"slip, slop, slap\" (slip on a shirt, slop on sun block and slap on a hat...)\n\nHad a great weekend, however. We all went up to the Bay of Plenty on Saturday morning and stayed at Tauranga. Went hiking up Mount Maunganui, swam in the hot thermal pools, parasailed in the sea and drove around lots. The weekend didn't go without a hitch, however, in that there was a bit of fall-out following Friday night's trip to Leftfield. Can't say too much because people might get offended, but there'd been inter-house snogging which meant only six of us making the trip to the Bay.\n\nSue's outraged she didn't know until the following day and we await further developments. When you're in a relationship any gossip about other people's love lives becomes ten times more interesting!\n\nPhotos coming soon. Honest!  And while you're on the internet, have a look at the The Top 10 Greatest Moments in Simpsons History (link courtesy of Kottke). Must remember not to laugh out loud at work."
