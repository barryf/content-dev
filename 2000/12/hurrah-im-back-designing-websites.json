      "Hurrah! I'm back designing websites! Executive Taskforce want me to stay on until March and are paying me lots of cash and letting me re-design their corporate websites. Said yes, obviously.  Sue's now on a fixed term contract which makes things a lot more \"secure\" and we can start saving for travelling next year. Weather's still bonkers: the sun's shining, it's lovely and hot but it's December!\n\nHad my first pint since leaving Britain, last night. And it was Kronenbourg! Fed up with \"handles\" and the girly half glasses they have over here. Kiwi beer (Lion Red, Steinlager, Speight's Gold) is okay, but nowhere near as welcome as a Kronenbourg. Sue and I were on a mini pub crawl, drinking at Hugo's Frog Bar (where they brew their own lagers), a 20th birthday party for one of Sue's workmates (\"Get to bed\") and Murphy's. Normally I hate Irish theme bars with happy-go-lucky Irish ex-pats but, as I might have mentioned, they served Kronenbourg!\n\nJust had a roasted tomato bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese for lunch... backpacker, my arse."
