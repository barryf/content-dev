      "It's all winding down over here in the run up to Christmas. Everyone's talking about their \"summer break\", planning beach holidays between Christmas and New Year. I suppose it makes sense: take your annual holiday around the public holidays and then have more time left for the rest of the year. Just doesn't feel right. Sue and I are going up to the Coromandel - a Pennisula in the Bay of Plenty - for a few days before New Year on our own. Well, when in Rome and all that...\n\nSaw Charlie's Angels on Wednesday. Average entertainment with a mostly near-naked Cameron Diaz which helped. Films aren't too far behind home and we might go back and see Unbreakable next week. TV's still appalling, though, with the highlight of the week's scheduling on Tuesday: \"Oh What A Night!\" on TVNZ 2 consisting of Dharma and Greg, Then Came You and Shortland Street. God help us all.\n\nJust found out that President Clinton and Blair were at Warwick yesterday! Giving speeches in the Arts Centre on the stage where I was graduated! Just when I leave the damn place something exciting happens. Apparantly, Clinton's goons were searching everyone who went into the Union and there were helicopters everywhere. All seems so far away."
