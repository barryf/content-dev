{"type":["h-entry"],"properties":{"content":["Just finished reading The Stars' Tennis Balls by Stephen Fry. Began with usual public school setting, class issues and young boys' feelings but developed into a much darker story about jealousy and revenge. Began reading it on Sunday, lazing in the garden in the sun, and couldn't put it down. Thoroughly recommended.\n\nDan's suggested going to see Unbreakable tonight but, given that everyone's largely skint and knackered, we'll probably save ourselves for Fringe Ben's party tomorrow night. We've also got our massive turkey to buy in readiness for Christmas. I've been nominated as Stu's assistant in the kitchen which unfortunately means I'll have to run and fetch when, with an inevitable hangover, I'll actually want to run and wretch. Ho ho ho.\n\nOh, and eagle-eyed surfers may have spotted me on Am I Hot Or Not (strange people send in photos of themselves and visitors mark them out of ten). Before you email with abuse, I'm not quite sad enough to have actually sent myself in - Phil, Dunc and co sent in photos of us from the Final Fling and are making a league table. Apparantly, I'm currently in second place with an average of 8. Surely not?"],"published":["2000-12-19T00:00:00Z"],"slug":["just-finished-reading-stars-tennis"],"entry-type":["note"],"category":["travelblog"]}}
