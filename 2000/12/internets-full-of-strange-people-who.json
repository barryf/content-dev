      "The Internet's full of strange people who put strange things into search engines. Here's me thinking I'm reasonably interesting when I get a few visits in my stats only to discover it's because people stumble on my page from Yahoo looking for things I've innocuously mentioned. Some top reasons for visiting my site are apparantly:Ladyboys(mentioned from when I was in Thailand)Schoolgirls(from a photo of Kel and Lou in fancy dress as schoolgirls)Kate(as if there aren't millions on the Internet!)But the most sought after item is... Truth or Dare Jenga! I've had at least a dozen people linking to me simply because I wrote that my housemates bought it for me for my birthday. Bonkers. If you're one of the Jenga fans, buy a box. It's, erm, great!\n\nIt can't have escaped your attention that it's that time of year again. I've been nominated chef #2 for Christmas day which means I get to sweat all morning stuffing my bird in the kitchen... and then I'll get round to cooking the turkey (arf arf).  Should be good to have the \"family\" (us British lot) all together, lots of alcohol and food.  We've all been buying $10 presents for each other so we'll all have crap to play with. Then, all going well, Sue and I are heading off on our own to the Coromandel before New Year. Weather's going to be hot, the sea will be warm and we can top up our tans in the sun. Not exactly our usual December.\n\nMerry Christmas, have fun, have a happy new year, get fat, drink lots and I'll write again early next year!"
