      "MSN Messenger is a fantastic thing. Just by leaving myself logged in at work I've got back in contact with three lost mates whose Hotmail addresses I'd put into the system and found they were online too. Up pops a little window and I'm chatting to people on the other side of the planet. Amazing.\n\nSomething else that I've just discovered is travelblog.net, \"a new weblog dedicated to breaking out of provincial mindsets.\" In other words, a weblog for and about backpackers and travellers, with links off to pages like mine. A fab 'blogger called Dori quoted something I'd written a few weeks ago and linked back to me. She's got her own weblog called saranwarp.com with some amazing photos of places she's been to so have a look! It's a damn-sight more interesting than all this bollocks."
