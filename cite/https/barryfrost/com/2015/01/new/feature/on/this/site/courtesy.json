      "New feature on this site courtesy of Bridgy: I can now “like” photos on Instagram. Using Quill I first post a like to an Instagram photo’s permalink. This is then sent to my site’s endpoint which creates the page and sends a webmention for Bridgy to notify Instagram. Meanwhile my site grabs the image thumbnail and title to display on my site.  \n\n For example: here’s a like from this morning: https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/11-084931 \n\n All very easy. I just glue together the loosely coupled pieces."
