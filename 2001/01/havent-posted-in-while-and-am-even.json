      "Haven't posted in a while and am even starting to lag behind Stu in the weblog stakes. Must try harder. Suppose it's a combination of working hard and not doing enough fun things. Not selling this post very well am I?!\n\nAnyway, Sue and I went to Muriwai beach yesterday to see some beaches and cliffs where a huge gannet colony roosts.  It's only about half an hour away but Sue's map-reading left much to be desired. Well, she's only female. At least I got to see Auckland Harbour Bridge four times as we went round in circles!  We're actually back off to the west coast again today with Helen to go to Piha beach where The Piano was filmed. Meanwhile Rich, Joanna and Dan are trying for the third time to catch the ferry to Rangitoto after having failed for the last month. Honestly, for supposedly travel-savvy backpackers who've managed to get half-way round the world, we're completely crap at going anywhere local!\n\nWent to the Rose and Crown pub on Friday night.  It was our third time there but our fondness for it is quickly diminshing given the fact that the same band have played there every time with the same set list of covers.  Sue's desperately keen to go somewhere else like the Salsa bar at the end of the road but I'm not sure if we're smart enough.  Dan would certainly have to shave his (largely ginger) beard off!  We've been a bit rude recently in underlining our opposition: for example, Rich blue-tacked ten disposable razors all over the house with comments like \"Shave first, eat later\" next to one on the fridge.  Well, it made us laugh."
