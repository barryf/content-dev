      "Sadly no further mice sightings but I haven't forgotten and will set about my task with renewed enthusiasm when we come back from the Great Barrier Island. We're staying at the Stray Possum Lodge over the long weekend - Aucklanders get a \"statutory\" holiday to celebrate its anniversary - and are leaving straight after work! It's been a while since the whole gang has had a holiday together and it'll be good to get away from tired evenings in watching Grosse Pointe, Shortland Street and all the other crap on Kiwi television.\n\nJoanna's now created her Stortrooper. I'll try and do the rest of the house when I've got an hour to spare!"
