      "I saw a mouse! Where? There on the stair. Where on the stair? Right there... Looks like we've got a small family of mice/rats living behind our crusty cooker and under the cupboards.  Joanna, me and now Helen have seen the little bastards scrambling over the cooker rings and behind the cupboards.  This is excellent news because it means I can buy a mouse trap and kill them!  More realistically, given that I live with two vegetarian/non-red meat animal lovers, they'll have to be evicted in a caring way. Rats, as it were.  I feel a saga coming on: more soon.\n\nSue's now booked our tickets for this weekend: we're going to the Great Barrier Island just up the coast in the Hauraki Gulf. The ferry takes about two hours and we leave on Friday evening so we'll probably have a few cheeky halves on board to start the weekend off.  We've even booked activities: kayaking round the island, snorkelling and mountain bikes.  Roll on Friday!\n\nOh, and don't worry about Rich, Dan and Stu: apparantly it was some sort of computer jiggerypokery after all. Phew!"
