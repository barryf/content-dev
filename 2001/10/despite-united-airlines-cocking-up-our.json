      "Despite United Airlines cocking up our seat reservations on the flight from Honolulu, we've made it okay to LA.  We're staying in West Hollywood at the Orbit Hotel which is more backpackery than swanky but close enough to the action.  Bit of a mad place, lots of nutters, smog and cars but not as intimidating as I'd expected.  Disneyland and Universal Studios are booked this week and then we've got a four-day jaunt to Las Vegas next week.  And then home!"
