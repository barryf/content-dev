{"type":["h-entry"],"properties":{"content":["If anyone was in any doubt how seriously they're taking the terrorist threat over here, you only need to visit some of the major tourist attractions.  Sue and I caught the one-hour bus to Pearl Harbour yesterday with Sue carrying a little bag, cameras and not much more.  Big mistake: signs and guards everywhere warned against taking anything in with you. Despite offering to either leave the bag outside the gates with the guards or even for them to thoroughly empty and examine its contents, we were turned away and because we came by bus we couldn't exactly leave it in our car.  So we went back home.  Everyone here's so jumpy that even common sense is being set aside.  I can't really condemn that but just hope things might get a little more settled soon."],"published":["2001-10-11T00:00:00Z"],"slug":["if-anyone-was-in-any-doubt-how"],"entry-type":["note"],"category":["travelblog"]}}
