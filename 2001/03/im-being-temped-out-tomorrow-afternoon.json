      "I'm being temped out tomorrow afternoon by my consultant to North Shore hospital to \"fix a website that's been written in JavaScript rather than HTML\"(?)  Didn't think it was worth correcting Barbara (an English ex-pat who in typical northern fashion calls a spade a spade) and it means I get to save the day and be a Web Hero (TM) for an afternoon!\n\nThe parents have now left the country after their whirlwind ten-day visit.  Sue and I took them for a bit of culture to Auckland Museum and to see Nurse Betty on Saturday.  The former tried a bit hard to cover the entire history of New Zealand; Te Papa in Wellington is supposed to be much better.  Nurse Betty, however, was quite good (albeit no-one else's taste!): Morgan Freedman and Chris Rock are violent western-esque characters that formed one plot while (insane real-life wife of Jim Carrey) Renee Zellweger is the miserable widowed suburban housewife who, through post-traumatic stress, looks for happiness in a soap star she thinks is real.  Yeah, it's a bit weird."
