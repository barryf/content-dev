      "Sue and I have now moved back to the hostel we stayed in when we first came to Auckland.  We're even back on the same floor and it all feels very much like home.  Only here until Saturday but we can now stay out late in the City without worrying about catching ferries home and walking up the Steepest Hill In The World. Probably. Helen's also staying there and, with Joanna just up the road, most of the old Ponsonby gang are back in town.\n\nHad a good last day at work: couple of drinks with everyone in the boardroom before going on to The Empire down the road. Even had a card and a little present. Wasn't expecting anything seeing as I was just a temp! So, cheers to everyone back at ET - it was lots of fun working with you all and I'll definitely come back and see you when we pass through Auckland in September.\n\nAnother Pom, Sue's sister Amy, is now also in the country and I'm her designated tour guide while Sue's working. Seems to be enjoying herself, especially yesterday when we went jet skiing and kite flying up at Muriwai beach.  David, who I'd worked with over the last four months, and Lara took Amy and us out on the water while poor Sue was at work. Really grateful to the both of them for giving up their day and taking us out. Absolutely amazing feeling riding into the waves, chasing the surf and flying through the air when the water disappears. Muriwai's one of the windiest and wavy beaches going so it was a bit of a baptism of fire. It was all very petrolhead with so much power behind you and I can't recommend it enough. Sue was a bit jealous sitting at her desk and answering phones all day but I'm sure we'll both get the opportunity to do it again together!"
