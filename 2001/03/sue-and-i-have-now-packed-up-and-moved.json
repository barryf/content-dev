{"type":["h-entry"],"properties":{"content":["Sue and I have now packed up and moved just across the Hauraki Gulf to Devonport.  We're already missing our little \"family\" and it was really quite sad waving Helen off on her coach to Wellington on Saturday.  Joanna's living in a swanky appartment with a dishwasher and Dan's somewhere in the North Island.  Now I've only got Sue to torment!\n\nHad a fun last Friday night together watching the Auckland Blues beat the Christchurch Crusaders at Eden Park before going to the Rose and Crown and the Loaded Hog.  The rugby was poor - too many scrappy penalties, loose mauls and knock-ons - and I can imagine England thrashing the All Blacks' on recent form.  Finishing off our alcohol probably wasn't the wisest move given that we had to scrub and clean the house the morning after, as a hungover Sue discovered.\n\nSo, we're living on Calliope (pronounced Cal-ee-aye-pee) Road, about two minutes' walk from the ferry terminal. Our cute little bedsit comes with a sink, hob and a small fridge/freezer and even our own TV. We're living with our Dutch landlord, an Asian couple and Leanne (Kiwi) and Craig (Scottish). Sue's very impressed with the big New World supermarket (good chicken and pork, apparantly) and the Glengarry round the corner.  Sue's not very impressed with the stupidly steep hill on the way back!"],"published":["2001-03-06T00:00:00Z"],"slug":["sue-and-i-have-now-packed-up-and-moved"],"entry-type":["note"],"category":["travelblog"]}}
