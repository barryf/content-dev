      "Long time since I've written but it's been a busy week.  My parents flew in from home on a whirlwind holiday that includes Singapore and Australia.  Sue and I have been full-time tour guides and trip planners since they arrived but it's been fun showing them around \"our\" city.  Had a couple of days off work and took them to Waiheke and Rangitoto by ferry and up the Sky Tower.  They've hired a campervan and are staying on nearby Takapuna Beach (playground of the rich, apparantly) and have taken us out to dinner every night since they got here as thanks.  Who are we to complain?!\n\n6 days left at Executive Taskforce and there's still mountains to do - including finishing off the website.  Been given a few contacts down in Wellington but seeing as Sue and I are only planning to be there for a couple of months, I'm not crossing any fingers yet.\n\nAnd may I be the first to declare my love for the Russians.  Bring on the Spanish!"
