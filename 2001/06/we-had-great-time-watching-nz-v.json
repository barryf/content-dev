      "We had a great time watching NZ v Australia in the World Cup Play-Off, despite the embarrassing lack of quality on show.  Unsurprisingly the Kiwis lost and reminded me of a mid-nineties Arsenal: not very talented but hardworking and committed.  The rugby was excellent on Saturday too (with Joanna at the Backbencher) with the All Blacks thrashing Argentina and then the British Lions deservedly beating a dirty, whingeing New South Wales team. Roll on the first test!"
