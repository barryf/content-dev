      "The sun's finally made it out from the rainclouds just as Sue and I set off on the Coogee to Bondi Beach walk.  It's basically full of beautiful people walking dogs.  Sydney's growing on us, especially Coogee where we're staying at the moment.\n\nI think our stumbling on the All Blacks' line-out training session did them no favours; they lost in the last minutes of the Tri-Nations decider against Australia, cocking up the huge majority of their line-outs.  We watched at a Coogee pub with a strangely evenly-split crowd of Kiwis and Aussies.  Once again the \"Lucky Country\" beat another of our teams, the flamin' mongrels."
