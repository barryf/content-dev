      "This sorry excuse for a travelblog has now reached over 1000 visits and it's up to about 20-a-day. Hopefully some of you enjoy what I write and aren't just searching for ladyboys and naked Shortland Street pictures, although looking at my referrals tells a different story. Thanks everyone for visiting and (hopefully) reading this rubbish!\n\nWhat cheese are you?  I'm a Danablu, unsurprisingly a Danish blue cheese. Mmm. (Link from dutchbint.org).\n\nGoing round Fringe Ben's massive 12-bedroom house tonight to meet its residents and see if the room he promised us is up to scratch. Only a month left before we're moving out of our home and we've still got to tell the landlord (who thinks we're staying for a year - whoops!), advertise in the paper, sort out final bills, sell Bertha and a million-and-one other things."
