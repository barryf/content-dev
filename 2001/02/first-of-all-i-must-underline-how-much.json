      "First of all I must underline how much we're all missing our Richard.  Poor Big Rich is feeling alone and neglected travelling on his own and has pointed out to me that I'm a bastard for not missing him in a written form.  Fair point.  So, Richard, if you're reading this, start pulling some of the 18 year old totty on your bus and stop being such a big girl's blouse.\n\nSecondly, Sue and I are no longer homeless!  We're moving into the cool bedsitty flat in Devonport we visited yesterday downstairs from my workmate Leanne.  We'll also be sharing with her Scottish boyf Craig, a budgie, a cat, some Japanese and a so-laidback-he's-horizontal Dutchman called Rick (our landlord).  We're looking forward to daily ferry rides to and from work in the sunshine and a plethora of takeaways, offys, a supermarket and beaches on our doorstep."
