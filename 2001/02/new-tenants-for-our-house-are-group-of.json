      "The new tenants for our house are a group of young Kiwi students, fresh out of school and moving out of their parental homes. We met four of them last night, all 18 years old, bright eyed, eager and full of life. Us haggard, creaking British twentysomethings suddenly looked and felt very old as we contemplated cooking dinner, watching Shortland Street and the ironing that needed doing.  Oh to be young again! (he says with all of his 22 world-wise years...)\n\nThe weather's unbearable at the moment in Auckland. It's so bloody humid all the time that you end up feeling sticky and irritable just walking down the street. You get a brief respite from the heat with a sudden downpour and then it's back to the muggyness. Fortunately we've got air conditioning at work but stepping outside the front door reminds me of walking out of the plane into the Bangkok heat. And as for the flies and mosquitos... Apparantly it's freezing back home in England but give me a nice, cold refreshing Winter anyday.  You're all so lucky!\n\nNo big plans for the weekend. Going to a barbeque with Sue tonight but otherwise it's shopping for Jesus sandals tomorrow and sitting down in a quiet place.  Everyone at work are asking which island I'm off to this weekend but I suppose that's because we've got a reputation for kerrazy weekends away. Need to save up so I can afford the next spurt of travelling."
