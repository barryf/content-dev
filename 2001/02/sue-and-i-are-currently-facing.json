      "Sue and I are currently facing homelessness as of Saturday.  We'd arranged with Fringe Ben to move into his 12-bedroom house at the end of February.  We weren't overly concerned when he announced that because he was leaving Auckland he was handing the responsibility of the house onto his housemate, Conor.  We should've been concerned, though, as since then Conor has also left town and the current incumbents have just let out the last room in the house, unaware of what had gone on before.  \"Bollocks,\" we thought.\n\nAll could be saved, however, as we're going to look at a studio flat in nearby Devonport.  Although this sadly means we'll have to leave Ponsonby, it also happily means we get to live by the seaside with the City just a 10-minute ferry ride away.  The gorgeous Cheltenham Beach is also conveniently just at the end of the road.  Chickens, however, shall not be counted.\n\nQuiet, relaxing weekend otherwise.  Joanna's friends arrived yesterday from the Cook Islands and, other than being largely northern, seem okay.  Poor Joanna's recovered from her Night of Shame (chundering within ten minutes of arriving at the pub, losing purse, inappropriate text messaging, etc.) and seems very chirpy now that Jim's here.\n\nTickets are now booked for Friday for the Auckland Blues' first home match of the Rugby Super 12's against the Canterbury Crusaders. Despite playing a bit of rugby at school and for Chelmsford, I've never seen a professional match.  These two are apparantly the best so I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nFinally, sorry to spoil Comic Relief but here's Ali G interviewing a humiliated Posh and Becks."
