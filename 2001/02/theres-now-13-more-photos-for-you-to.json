      "There's now 13 more photos for you to enjoy, mostly from our trip to Great Barrier Island but there's also some from Piha and Muriwai beaches. Just wish the scans could do justice to how blue the water was and how green the trees were - far cry from Essex!\n\nTalking of back home, I'm missing a big Warwick Boar reunion in London.  The Boar was the student newspaper at Warwick and I grew quite attached to the old thing and those who worked on it, so \"hi\" to any ex-Boar members reading this and have a few beers in my honour!\n\nSue and I are planning our next few months: looks like Fringe Ben's house is a definite for when we move out and then we'll probably leave Auckland at the end of March. We'll then \"do\" the rest of the North Island in April, settling down in Wellington and work for a couple of months before cashing in our Kiwi Experience South Island tickets in July.  We'll spend a month in Oz, visiting my relatives in Melbourne and driving through Canberra and Sydney before spending a couple of weeks in Fiji and Hawaii.  Finally we'll spend about a month in LA and then head home in late October.  Shit, that's months away!\n\nLatest in the \"what are you?\" tests: what flavour are you?"
