      "Damn that Anna Kournikova to Hell! Have now seen the back of her... well, not literally... that would actually be quite nice.  And, while I'm linking, I knew it would only be a matter of time before there was a serious accident while someone was text messaging. The amount of times I've almost walked under a bus while walking down the street trying to compose a text message...\n\nCan't have escaped your attention that it was Valentine's Day yesterday but is it my imagination or is it getting even more commercialised out of all proportion? Luckily I was in the fortunate minority of people that actually had \"Valentines\" and had a spanking Chinese at the Dragon Boat followed by ridiculously cheap beer at Margarita's with Sue. Was a bit concerned earlier in the day when Helen texted to say there were two cards waiting for Sue at home, in addition to the one I'd given her. Fortunately it turns out they were from Rich and Stu who also sent them to Helen and Joanna. Alarm over!\n\nMoving out day's drawing closer: our landlord's meeting our shortlist of potential new tenants tonight. Poor Joanna's had literally hundreds of phone calls since we put our house in the paper and has now whittled the groups down to four and, amazingly, not entirely composed of \"fit men\". Hope they don't find our mouse traps!"
