      "Sue and I had an extremely pleasant and sophisticated Saturday at the Devonport Food and Wine Festival. We sipped Chardonnays, Rieslings and Sauvignon Blancs from around the country, basking in the sunshine and relaxing to the jazz. Pity 25,000 other Aucklanders had the same idea but it wasn't too crowded and we had a fantastic ferry ride there and back.\n\nKilled a mouse last night. I'd assumed that putting mouse traps out would mean a quick, sharp death for the poor little bastards.  But, no, I came upstairs last night to find one wriggling around, head clamped at a horrific angle in the trap and his eyes bulging. Kindest thing to do was put him out of his misery and, as I brought down the Broom of Justice, Sue screamed in an extremely uncharacterstic girly manner. Feel a bit guilty but, in our mice-infested house, it's honestly either us or them!\n\nHate Valentine's Day? Send your ungrateful other a Dutchbint Evil Valentine's."
