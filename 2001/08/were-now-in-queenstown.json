      "We're now in Queenstown, the bungy/jetboat/extreme capital of the Southern Hemisphere after a mad week of Kiwi Experience.  Against better judgement we did a 12000ft tandem skydive on Sunday morning, freefalling for 45 seconds.  Very strange feeling that you just can't describe but, despite being scared stupid, I want to do another just so that I can know what to expect and appreciate things like seeing the plane disappear above you so quickly. Amazing feeling.\n\nFar too much to summarise here but... we briefly stayed in Nelson, through Westport, Greymouth, Mahinapua, Franz Josef and Wanaka, drinking too much and doing glacier walking, waterfall walks and a bizarre drag party in an Arse End Of Nowhere pub which \"specialises\" in such night for each coach-load of twentysomethings that passes through.  Met a range of (mostly English) travellers, most of whom had just arrived in the country; Sue and I are definitely the exception.  We're off to Dunedin tomorrow and then back for some skiing/snowboarding next week."
