      "After the progress we made on our first ever day of skiing, our second day was a lot less encouraging.  After learning the basics of stopping and turning on a gentle slope, we realised that we weren't as good as we thought we were when skiing down a steeper slope.  We were itching to try the much steeper chairlift slopes but were still not good enough.  Impatient and disenchanted, we could no longer be arsed and went home.  In a huff.\n\nQuick disclaimer: we've been in New Zealand where everything is beautiful for 10 months and so amazing feats of nature no longer excite us as they should...  On Wednesday we spent five hours travelling on a coach to and from Milford Sound which consists of enormous fjords with mountains and waterfalls on either side and you ride through it on a boat.  Ho hum.  \n\nWe're now in Christchurch which is warm, very English and very relaxing.  Flying out to Sydney on Sunday so - blimey - this could actually be my last post from NZ!"
