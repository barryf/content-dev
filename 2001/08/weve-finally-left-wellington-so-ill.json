      "We've finally left Wellington so I'll have no excuse for being so slack in posting to this thing.  It was a strange feeling waving goodbye to the place - we'd made friends, had cool jobs and it was very tempting to stay but it was time to move on.  It was beautiful day for the ferry trip across Cook Strait: the sea was flat and the sun was shining.  The highlight of the trip was a young German boy breaking his glasses and then running to his mother crying (what we could hear) \"my glasses are kaputt!!\".  A new word-of-the-trip has thus been coined.  \n\nWe're now staying in seaside town Picton which is strangely devoid of tourists.  We stumbled on a small pub last night with some colourful local characters.  We thankfully managed to hold on to our beers, though, when a big bloke decided to exact revenge on the floor next to us on a lad in the pub who had squirted his urchin son with a water pistol.  We left shortly afterwards.  This afternoon we're going on a walk round the 'Sounds before we set off down the West coast on the Kiwi Experience bus tomorrow morning."
