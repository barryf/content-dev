      "The British and Irish Lions were humbled in the test series in Australia; England are currently being completely annihilated in the Ashes cricket series against Australia; The Sydney Olympics were an unqualified success and Australia was just voted the second best country on Earth to live in.  Kind of makes you want to be Australian, doesn't it?  Well, I've just heard from my second/third(?) cousins from Melbourne who barely know me but have offered to meet Sue and me when we get there in September, give us somewhere to stay, show us around their city and generally take care of us.  How nice is that?!"
