      "Still no job and, although I've just had my third personnel agency interview in successive days with positive feedback and test results, it's starting to piss me off. The only job I've (jokingly) been offered is sorting bottles of urine for some testing lab. That's what it's come to!  Doesn't help that Sue's just started a month-long office job leaving me bored in the flat with only god-awful Kiwi TV for comfort.\n\nWent to Te Papa, the free national museum, over the weekend. Throughly impressed and entertained and we couldn't even manage to see everything we wanted to in one day. We've got plans to see a play at one of Wellington's many theatres this weekend and start exploring the pubs and bars in Courtenay Place, the main entertainment street. Fingers crossed I'll have something to celebrate!"
