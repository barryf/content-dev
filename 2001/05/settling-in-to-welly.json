      "Settling in to Welly. Sue and I have been badgering the many recruitment agencies with phone calls and emailed CVs and have a few positive leads. I'll actually have to be a bit more mindful of what I write here though: in an interview at Lacey Lee on Tuesday my consultant had read this weblog and knew all about me! Bit unsettling but no harm was done and I think it helped him get a better picture of me. Sue's got a day's work this week and I'm crossing fingers about a few opportunities. Need some cash to pay back that fine...\n\nHaven't actually seen too much of the touristy side of the city. Dan came round for a few beers last night at our Kingston Mansion and we're going to a restaurant with Joanna tonight. Apart from that, the limits of our new experiences are catching a trolley bus (bit like a tram with overhead electricity cables but otherwise a normal bus) and sitting in new internet cafes like, erm, this one."
