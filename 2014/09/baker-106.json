We need words for the following please: <a href=\"http://t.co/oZgd7va0cl\">pic.twitter.com/oZgd7va0cl</a></p>&mdash; David Schneider (@davidschneider) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidschneider/status/507848267057876992\">September 5, 2014</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nOn the Twitter website the image is then rendered inline but in other clients you just get a thumbnail/link."
