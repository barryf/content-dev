      "Fun discovery yesterday: my car is 4G. \r\n\r\nI have a [Three](http://www.three.co.uk) SIM card for data from which it creates a wifi hotspot, displays live traffic updates, plays Spotify, etc. \r\n\r\nDriving along the M25 I notice a little '4G' icon appear. Sadly I was a little too busy driving to use it."
