Well done, tickbot.\r\n\r\nThe [source](https://github.com/barryf/tickbot) is available on GitHub if you'd like to poke around."],"published":["2014-03-14T16:31:30Z"],"entry-type":["note"],"category":["project","globaldev","via-baker"],"syndication":["https://twitter.com/barryf/status/444513134595018752"],"slug":["baker-89"]}}
