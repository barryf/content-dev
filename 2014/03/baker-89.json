      "Introducing [tickbot](https://github.com/barryf/tickbot):\r\n\r\nTickbot is a very simple app/script that reminds our [team](http://globaldev.co.uk/team) in [Slack](https://slack.com) to do their time tracking in [Tick](http://www.tickspot.com) and cheerfully name-and-shames those who forgot the next morning. \r\n\r\nIt's clever enough to adapt to weekends and UK bank holidays so people aren't incorrectly nagged.\r\n\r\nI'm pleased to report that while our team have already started to curse tickbot when he badgers them, so far no one has forgotten to submit their time. Well done, tickbot.\r\n\r\nThe [source](https://github.com/barryf/tickbot) is available on GitHub if you'd like to poke around."
