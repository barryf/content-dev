      "[Homebrew Website Club comes to London](http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-03-19-homebrew-website-club)\n\n> Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy? If so, come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends that want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project, whatever...\n\nAs part of a deliberate attempt to attend more meet-ups I'm heading to next week's inaugural London meet-up of the Homebrew Website Club, an offshoot of the [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com) movement. \n\nAs the mission statement above suggests, it promises to be an opportunity to show others how I've built this thing and discuss ideas on how personal websites could develop. \n\nIf like me you're interested in this kind of stuff then [add yourself to the list](http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-03-19-homebrew-website-club) and come along.\n"
