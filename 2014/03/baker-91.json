      "Last night was the first [London Homebrew Website Club](http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-03-19-homebrew-website-club) meetup. I said a few words about this site and touched on some of the IndieWeb concepts I've been experimenting with, which seemed to go well. Strong turnout of about a dozen people: some completely new to the ideas and others who have been involved with the community for a while. \n\nAnd good to swap notes afterwards with [Glenn Jones](http://glennjones.net) who demonstrated his work-in-progress [Transmat](http://transmat.io) platform and to see some of the location functionality under the hood of [Tom Morris](http://tommorris.org)'s site. Checkins may be the next item type I add.\n\nThanks to [Chris Roos](http://chrisroos.co.uk) and Tom for organising.\n\n[My slides on Baker](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9n2vuh26xcw4lb4/homebrew_baker_2014-03-19.pdf).\n"
